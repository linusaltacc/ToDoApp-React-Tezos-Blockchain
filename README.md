# ToDoApp-React-Tezos

This project is a Todo app built using React and Taquito. The app allows users to create and manage a list of tasks on the Tezos blockchain. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and view all their tasks in one place. The app uses Taquito to interact with the Tezos blockchain and store the tasks in a smart contract.

What makes this project different and unique is its use of the Tezos blockchain to store and manage tasks. By using a decentralized platform like Tezos, the app ensures that user data is secure and transparent.
